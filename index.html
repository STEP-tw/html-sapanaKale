  <p title=" about butterfly">Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order
    Lepidoptera,
    which also includes moths. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings,
    and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea,
    which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea")
    and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies
    (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea").</p>

  <p>Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, which was about 56 million years ago.
    Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on
    which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly,
    and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete,
    the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded
    and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations
    in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may
    take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.</p>
